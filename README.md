# Soccer Stars - A sports themed Memory Game 

Soccer Stars is an interactive card-matching memory game with a football focused theme. 

I created this game for users of all ages to enjoy, particularly those who are sports fans. It was designed so that instructions are easy to follow and so that user are challenged with several levels of difficulty. It is also fully responsive so that users on different devices can enjoy the experience. 

Languages used in this project as part of my Code Institute portfolio are HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as Bootstrap and JQuery libraries to aid with functionality. The aim of the side is to highlight DOM manipulation using JS.

## UX

### User Stories 

#### First Time User 

Please see assets/testing for all images of each feature tested. 

As a first time user I want to be able to navigate around the site easily. 

* I want instructions to be clear and easy to understand, allowing for easy navigation. 

* I want the game to be easy to boot up and play. 

* I want to be able to replay the game without having to return to the main menu if I so choose.  

* I want to be able to select difficulty prior to playing the game. 

* I want to be challenged against the clock, which will tick as I play the game, adding a competitive element to the game.

* I want the site to display whether or not I have won the game, or if it is game over.

#### Returning User

* As a returning user, I want to be able to easily access and play the game.

* I want to be able to access the developer’s social media pages (in this case target _blank links).

* I want to be able to try harder difficulties if I didn't during first playthroughs. 


### Design

#### Strategy Plane

Soccer Stars was designed to give users an easy, enjoyable sports related memory test.
The main objective of the site is allow the user to flip, match and complete the puzzle using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JQuery.

#### Scope 

The scope of this project is to provide the user with an easily accessible web based game which they can play on devices of their choosing. The website will showcase the developers use of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, which creates the look of the site, as well as JavaScript, which adds functionality and creates an immersive experience for the user. 

### Structure Plane 

This website was structured with a home menu with options to see the game rules, start game . There is also the main game screen containing the cards to be flipped, a timer, and an exit to home button. 

Please refer to assets/testing for both main menu and game screen wireframes images. 


### Surface 

The colour choices for this game were made to create a stereotypical “sports event” feeling. I opted to use a strong blue, red and green colours for the menus, and a gold/yellow colours for the card which stood out well against the background. 

I used https://coolors.co/ for inspiration.

#### Font/Typography

I opted for Google Fonts’ “Graduate” font by Eduardo Tunni. This font was exactly what I felt the game needed, as it is commonly seen in collegiate sports typefaces in the US. I paired this with “Ubuntu” by Dalton Maag, as they are commonly used together. 


#### Images 

I opted to use some paid for game icon graphics from www.gamedevmarket.net. The pack I chose was the Soccer Football Icons Set, Cartoon Style by Ylivdesign. Originally I had selected a group of separate images, however for consistency of appearance, this icon pack was chosen.

I edited these using a free web-app alternative to Photoshop, Photopea, which allowed me to export the individual icons from eps file. 

The background image for the game screen and the main menu was taken from www.freepik.com, and the image chosen https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/gradient-football-field-background_15510127.htm#page=1&query=soccer%20background&position=8


### AUDIO

I had intended to use audio files which are in situ within the project, however I will be implementing them later. The goal for the audio files for future releases will be to increase the overall game experience for the user. 

The background music for the main menu was taken freely from www.opengameart.org. The file used was Opening Theme For Soccer Video Games by ISAo at https://airyluvs.com/ 　

The background music for the game screen was taken from https://www.chosic.com/. The file used was “Battle of Pogs” by Komiku.

General SFX for the game were as follows:
